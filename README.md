# Authentication in Unity

NextAuth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution.

This is an example application that shows how `next-auth` is applied to a basic Next.js app with Openfort.


## Demo

- [Video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/xBzl8hk__P8)
- [Live demo](https://sample-ssv-social-nextjs.vercel.app/)

This demo authenticates a player using NextAuth. It will create a custodial account for the player and collect an asset with it. Then, it transfers the account ownership from a Openfort custodial to a self-custodial account.

When running the application, after you log in, head to `/protected` route to see the demo in action.


## Features

- üè∞ Openfort Authentication.
- üè∞ [Openfort CSharp SDK](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/openfort-unreal-engine).

## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

```
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/samples
cd authentication-unity-sample
```


You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

Then, navigate to `Assets/Scripts/LoginSceneManager.cs` and replace the following values with your own:

```csharp
OpenfortAuth authClient = new OpenfortAuth("YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY");
```


**2. Configure Authentication Providers**
